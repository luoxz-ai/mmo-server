         Using the consequents-to-µ map, we:
         1) Scale each consequent by its µ value. This is called "implication," and
         this 'weights' the consequents properly. There are several common ways of
         scaling, such as Larsen (scaling) and Mamdani (clipping).

         2) "Defuzzify" into a crisp value by summing the consequents' contributions
         to the output in some sensibly weighted fashion.

         PGAIBE uses the average of the two shoulder points as the 'representative value',
         but other literature indicates that the actual, proper X centroid of the shape
         is a proper 'representative value.' So this routine does that.

         The defuzzification method scales the representative value of each consequent
         by its confidence (i.e. µ) and takes the average, like so:
